/*
Implement a Range-Based LCM Calculator
In this lab, you will create a function that takes an array of two numbers and returns the least common multiple (LCM) of those two numbers and all the numbers between them.

User Stories

1 You should have a `smallestCommons` function that accepts an array of two numbers as an argument.
2 The `smallestCommons` function should return the smallest common multiple that is evenly divisible by both numbers and all sequential numbers in the range between them.
3 The function should handle input where the two numbers are not in numerical order.

const smallestCommons = (arrayOf2Nos) => {
    return arrayOf2Nos;
}

console.log(smallestCommons([1, 5]));
